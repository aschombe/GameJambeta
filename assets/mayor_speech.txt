Hi there my name is Bill.
I am the mayor of the town. 
My self and the great people of this town have noticed 
some strange events happening, especially during the night.
And recently the FBI has set up camp at our local warehouse.
We believe something strange is going on.
Please investigate this and let us know if we are in danger.
I recommend starting your investigation at the community center, 
the big building in the middle of town, right next to the parking lot.
I look forward to hearing the results of your investigation.
and here is a flashlight, if you need batteries, you can find them around town.
